Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.


Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software Engineering is the systematic approach towards development, operation and maintenance of software. It integrates principles from both engineering and computer science to solve complex software projects in a structured way.
Traditional Programming primarily focuses on writing code to solve specific problems or perform specific tasks while software engineering involves the whole process of designing, planning, testing etc. This lead to minimal documentation in traditional programming, while software engineering focuses on documentation at every stage of the process. Software engineering emphasizes on collaboration of multiple teams such as the developer, stakeholders etc. while traditional programming was mainly at individual or small teams with minimal collaboration. Traditional programming does not employ systematic methodologies compared to software engineering where there is a structured approach to development. This makes software engineering a broader discipline than traditional programming.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) include;
•	Planning – involves defining the project scope, objectives, resources, timelines, and budget.
•	Requirement Analysis – business needs are translated into specific, detailed software requirements that are gathered and documented to ensure a clear understanding of what the software needs to accomplish. 
•	Design – focuses on creating the architecture and design of the software based on the requirements.
•	Implementation/ Development – the actual code is written based on the design specifications and the software is developed
•	Testing – involves validating and verifying that the software meets the requirements and is free of defects. Bugs are identified and fixed
•	Deployment – the software is released to the production environment and made available to users.
•	Maintenance –  software is monitored, updated and bug fixed. This ensures the software continues to function correctly and adapts to changing requirements


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile – This focuses on delivering working software in short cycles, continuously adapting to changing requirements. It promotes flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of functional software.
Waterfall – This model is a linear and rigid sequential approach to software development. Each phase must be completed before the next phase begins.

Waterfall is fixed, with little room for change after initial requirements are set while agile is highly flexible, with regular updates and changes based on feedback
Waterfall is limited to the initial and final stages while in agile there is ontinuous involvement and feedback throughout the project.
Waterfall has a sigher risk due to late testing and inflexibility while agile has reduced risk with continuous testing and iterative delivery.
Waterfall emphasizes on detailed documentation upfront while agile prioritizes working software over extensive documentation
Waterfall has a more soloed approace while agile fosters close relationship between stakeholders and collaborators

Agile is more suitable for;
	Projects where requirements are expected to change frequently.
	Large or complex projects that benefit from frequent reassessment and adjustment.
	Projects that require significant user input and feedback throughout development.
Waterfall is more suitable for;
	Projects with clear, unchanging requirements.
	Projects that require extensive documentation and traceability.
	Smaller projects with straightforward deliverables and minimal complexity.


Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirement Engineering is the process of understanding, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of all stakeholders (users, clients, developers) for a software system.
It involves processes such as;
a.	Requirements Elicitation: This is where you gather requirements through various techniques like interviews, workshops, and document analysis from stakeholders and other sources.
b.	Requirements Analysis: The gathered information is analysed to identify, categorize, and prioritize requirements. This is to ensure they are complete, clear, and feasible. Unclear or conflicting requirements are addressed here.
c.	Requirements Specification: The purpose is to formally document the analysed requirements in a clear and detailed manner. 
d.	Requirements Verification and Validation: Verify that the documented requirements reflect what stakeholders truly need. Validate that the final system meets those requirements. This ensure that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs and are feasible to implement.
e.	Requirements Management: Maintain and track requirements throughout the development lifecycle. This includes handling changes and ensuring traceability.

Its importance’s are such as;
a.	Ensures Stakeholder Satisfaction
b.	Reduces Risks
c.	Guides Development
d.	Improves Communication
e.	Enhances Quality
f.	Improves Efficiency

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?


Modularity in software design is the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, independent, and interchangeable modules or components. These modules perform specific, well-defined tasks and interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.
It improves maintainability by;
	Isolation: Changes to a single module are less likely to impact other parts of the system, making debugging and fixing issues easier. You can focus on the specific module with the problem. This reduces the risk of unintended side effects and makes it easier to debug and maintain the codebase
	Easier Debugging: Problems are localized to specific modules, making it quicker to identify and fix issues.
	Simplified Updates: Updates and enhancements can be applied to individual modules without needing to modify the entire system, reducing maintenance effort and risk.
	Readability: Modular code is easier to understand and navigate.
	Reusability: Well-designed modules can be reused in different parts of the same system or even in other projects.
It improves scalability by;
	Easier Integration: New modules can be easily integrated into the system as long as they adhere to the defined interfaces. This allows for future expansion and feature additions.
	Independent Growth: Modules can be independently scaled up or down based on changing requirements.
	Parallel Development: Teams can work on different modules concurrently, speeding up development and deployment times.


Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Software testing is aimed at identifying defects, errors, or bugs in the software to ensure it meets specified requirements and quality standards.
Its levels include;
a.	Unit Testing – It involves testing individual units of code (functions, classes) in isolation to verify they behave as expected with various inputs.
b.	Integration Testing – It involves test on how units interact and exchange data to ensure they function seamlessly as a whole.
c.	System testing – Tests the entire software system as a single entity against its functional and non-functional requirements (security, performance, usability) to ensure it meets specified requirements.
d.	Acceptance Testing – end-users or stakeholders formally test the software to determine if it meets their acceptance criteria. This validates if the software meets business requirements and user expectations and can be deployed for real-world use.
Testing is important because it;
	Identifies Defects: Testing helps identify bugs, errors, and issues in the software, ensuring they are fixed before release.
	Ensures Quality: Validates that the software meets functional, performance, security, and usability requirements. This leads to a more reliable and user-friendly product.
	Reduces Risks: By proactively finding and fixing issues, testing reduces the risk of software failures after deployment, saving time and money in the long run.
	Improves Customer Satisfaction: Ensures that the software behaves as expected, leading to higher customer satisfaction and retention.
	Supports Maintenance: Provides a safety net for ongoing maintenance and updates by ensuring changes do not introduce new issues.
	Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Ensures the software complies with relevant laws, regulations, and standards, reducing legal risks.


Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that track and manage changes to source code and other files.
Importances
Version Tracking – They keep a record of every change made to the code, with details like who made the change, when it was made, and a brief description.
Collaboration – Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously.
Security – They act as a secure repository for your code, protecting it from accidental deletion or loss. You can also control access permissions to ensure only authorized users can make changes.
Examples
Git – It allows developers to have a complete copy of the codebase on their local machines, enabling offline work and decentralized collaboration. Every developer has a local copy of the entire repository, enabling offline work and faster operations. Git offers powerful branching, merging, and conflict resolution functionalities. Operations like committing, branching, and merging are typically fast due to its design.
Mercurial – Has a slightly different workflow and command set from git but similar in terms of distribution. Mercurial is known for its ease of branching and merging, and its focus on code integrity. Known for its performance in handling large repositories and scaling with increased users. Provides a built-in web interface for repository browsing and management.
Subversion (SVN) – A centralized VCS with a simpler interface compared to Git. All changes are made on a central server, and developers work with a local copy of the latest version. SVN is popular for its ease of use and stability, but it offers less flexibility for branching and merging compared to Git. Tracks entire directories as versions rather than individual files
Perforce (Helix Core) – Known for its ability to handle large repositories and support thousands of concurrent users. Uses a central server for version control, providing strong consistency and control over file versions. Optimized for managing various types of files beyond source code, including binary files. Integrates with other tools and workflows commonly used in software development.


Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

The roles of a software project manager include;
	Project planning and scheduling
	Resource management
	Risk management
	Communication and collaboration
	Team leadership and management
	Quality assurance
	Stakeholder Management and communication
	Budget cost and management
	Closure and evaluation
Challenges includes;
o	Resource Constraints – Working with limited resources to achieve project goals.
o	Technical Challenges – Unforeseen technical hurdles that can arise during development, impacting timelines and costs.
o	Communication Issues – Miscommunication between team members, stakeholders, or clients can lead to misunderstandings and delays.
o	Meeting Deadlines – Balancing project scope with tight deadlines while maintaining quality is a constant juggle.
o	Team Dynamics – Managing team dynamics, conflicts, and motivation to ensure a collaborative and productive work environment.


Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance refers to the process of modifying a software product after it has been delivered to the customer to correct defects, improve performance, adapt to changes in the environment, or enhance functionality.
Types
a	Corrective Maintenance – focusing on fixing bugs and errors reported by users or identified during testing. It aims to resolve issues that impact functionality, performance, or security.
b	Adaptive Maintenance – involves modifying the software to adapt to changes in the environment, such as changes in hardware, operating systems, or regulatory requirements.
c	Perfective Maintenance – involves enhancing the software to improve its performance, usability, or maintainability based on user feedback or changing business needs. It might involve adding new features, improving user experience, or integrating with new technologies
d	Preventive Maintenance – the focus is on preventing problems before they occur. This involves tasks like code refactoring performance optimization, and updating documentation to maintain code clarity and reduce future maintenance effort.
Software maintenance is importance because;
Bugs are fixed and keeps the software running smoothly, preventing user frustration and potential downtime.
The software adapts to user needs and keeps it relevant in a changing technological landscape.
Effective maintenance prolongs the lifespan of software, maximizing its return on investment and supporting ongoing business operations.
Regular maintenance ensures that software continues to meet user expectations for reliability, performance, and features, enhancing overall customer satisfaction.
Proactive preventive maintenance helps reduce the occurrence of future issues, minimizing downtime, and costly emergency fixes.
